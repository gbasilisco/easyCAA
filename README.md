The project is a free interpretation of **AraSuite** platform, in particular of [AraWord](http://sourceforge.net/projects/araword/files/?source=navbar) module. AraWord works on client mode, **easyCCA** is a open&free software web-based. 

This is an attempt to build a easy platform to serve the teachers to use the CAA (**Augmentative and Alternative Communication**)

Moreover **easyCCA** can work on very basic OS like Windows RT.
